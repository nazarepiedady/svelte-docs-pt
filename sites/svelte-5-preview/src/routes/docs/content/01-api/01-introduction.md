Welcome to the Svelte 5 preview documentation! This is intended as a resource for people who already have some familiarity with Svelte and want to learn about the new <em>runes</em> API, which you can learn about in the [Introducing runes](https://svelte.dev/blog/runes) blog post.

You can try runes for yourself in the [playground](/), or learn more about our plans via the [FAQ](/docs/faq).
